# David Gawel's Kattis Solutions

This is a collection of my solutions for diffrent problems on [Kattis](Kattis.com) and also other various websites. To get the problems you can type the names of the files into Google and the problems should come up.

About 90% of my solutions get accepted in this repo, there are some where I have multiple attempts for one problem but only one attempt gets accepted (usually the file with the highest number). 
There are also other problems where I have some attempts but none of them get accepted.
All code is written by me except: 
- the TrieNode class in substringQueryProblem.py (from the aho corasik pip module)
- the GFG class in gregorAndThePawnGame.py (a bipartite matching algorithm off of [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-bipartite-matching/))
